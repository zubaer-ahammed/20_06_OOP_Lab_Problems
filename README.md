Problem 01 (Using JavaFX): Write a java program that works as a simple calculator. Use a Grid Layout to arrange Buttons for digits and for the +, -,*, and % operations. Add a text field to display the result.	
Problem 01 (Using Swing): Write a java program that works as a simple calculator. Use a Grid Layout to arrange Buttons for digits and for the +, -,*, and % operations. Add a text field to display the result.	
Problem 02: Write a java program to find prime numbers between 1 to n.	
Problem 03: Write a Java program that prints all real solutions to the quadratic equation ax2+bx+c=0. Read in a, b, c and use the quadratic formula.	
Problem 04: Create a base class Fruit which has name, taste, and size as its attributes. A method called eat() is created which describes the name of the fruit and its taste. Inherit the same in 2 other class Apple and Orange and override the eat() method to represent each fruit taste.	
Problem 05: Write a java program to illustrate the concept of class with method overloading.	
Problem 06: Write a Java Program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains two integers and an empty method named print Area(). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle and Circle such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the classes contains only the method print Area () that prints the area of the given shape.	
Problem 07: Develop a java application with Employee class with Emp_name, Emp_id, Address, Mail_id, Mobile_no as members. Inherit the classes, Programmer, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and Professor from employee class. Add Basic Pay (BP) as the member of all the inherited classes with 97% of BP as Dearness allowance (DA), 10% of BP as House Rent Allowance (HRA), 12% of BP as Provident Fund (PF), 0.1% of BP for staff club fund. Generate pay slips for the employees with their gross and net salary.	
Problem 08 (Using JavaFX): Write a program that creates a user interface to perform integer divisions. The user enters two numbers in the text fields, Num1 and Num2. The division of Num1 and Num2 is displayed in the Result field when the Divide button is clicked. If Num1 or Num2 were not an integer, the program would throw a NumberFormatException. If Num2 were Zero, the program would throw an Arithmetic Exception Display the exception in a message dialog box.

Problem 09: Write a Java program that handles all mouse events and shows the event name at the center of the window when a mouse event is fired. (Use adapter classes).	
Problem 10: Develop a java application to implement currency converter (Dollar to BDT, EURO to BDT, Yen to BDT and vice versa), distance converter (meter to KM, miles to KM and vice versa), time converter (hours to minutes, seconds and vice versa) using packages.	
Problem 11: Write a JAVA program to implement Interface using extends keyword.
